#The Odin Project Assignments

These are my completed assigments for the [Web Dev 101](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/) course of the free online bootcamp, The Odin Project. I'm completing these as a supplement to my learning of front end development to get more hands-on JavaScript projects under my belt.
